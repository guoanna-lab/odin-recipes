    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Beef dumplings are a staple meal or side to your dinner or lunch! They are a way to cure a empty stomach in a good way!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef (at least 20% fat) </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
        <li>3 stem of chopped green onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves minced Garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup sesame oil</li>
        <li>20 dumpling wrappers</li>
        <li>1/2 Nappa cabbage chopped</li>
        <li>Bowl of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dumpling filling, add the ground beef to a large bowl. 
            Chop up the green onions, garlic, soy sauce, grated ginger, sesame oil.
            Use your hands to mix the filling together.
            Cover bowl and let it marinate for at least 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Once the filling is ready, grab the dumpling wrappers. You will scoop a spoonful of filling into the middle of the dumpling wrapper.
            In one hand, hold the dumpling wrapper and with the other dip your finger into the bowl of water and coat the edges of the filling.
            This will help seal the dumpling.
        </li>
        <li>
            To fold the dumpling, you will want to close it in a hot-dog style fold. You will want to create half-inch ridges to seal the dumpling.
        </li>
        <li>To cook the dumplings, you will heat up the skillet and cook them in batches that fit your pan.
            Add oil on medium heat. Add the dumplings with the seal face-up. 
            Pan sear the bottoms of the dumplings until brown and crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Once the bottoms are crispy to your liking, add a 1/2 cup of water to the pan and cover it with a lid to cook the insides more.</li>
        <li>Take them out after about 2 minutes and they are ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>
